# JadeView

Visual Studio Code extension to view current HTML file in
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) format. Useful for analyzing complex HTML files
without being distracted by the tag soup.

Usage: install extension (from VSCode marketplace) and open an HTML file. Run command
"Jade View" from command palette. This will display a Jade rendered version of the file
as a new, temporary document.

If you have text selected while you run the command, only the selected text
will be rendered as Jade.
